## Enhanced Content Review Checklist

### Section 1: Hero Headline & Subtitle

#### Dimensionalization Check
- [ ] Headline creates a specific visual scenario
- [ ] Subtitle shows concrete outcome, not abstract benefit
- [ ] Reader can "see" themselves experiencing the benefit

**Example Transformation:**

**Before (Generic):**
"Physical Therapy Alternative in Perrysburg: Why Energy Enhancement System May Be Better"

**After (Dimensionalized):**
"Stop Doing Painful PT Exercises That Make Your Condition Worse - Experience Healing While You Relax in Perrysburg"

#### Qualifier Removal Check
- [ ] No "may be," "might," "could"
- [ ] Direct, confident statements
- [ ] Present progressive tense used where appropriate

**Before:** "Why Energy Enhancement System May Be Better"  
**After:** "Why Energy Enhancement System Provides Better Results"

#### Social Impact Check
- [ ] Shows how others will perceive the reader
- [ ] Includes social proof or social scenarios
- [ ] Addresses social standing/desirability

**Example Addition:**
"Your friends will notice you moving easier. Your family will see you enjoying life again. Your doctor will be amazed at your progress."

---

### Section 2: Pain Point Dimensionalization

#### Current Pain Points Review

**Find all pain claims and transform them:**

**Before (Generic):**
"Chronic pain that hasn't responded to physical therapy"

**After (Dimensionalized):**
"You've been going to PT twice a week for 6 months. You're still doing those painful exercises at home every night. But when you wake up in the morning, the pain is still there. You're starting to wonder if you'll ever get better."

**Before (Generic):**
"Difficulty performing exercises"

**After (Dimensionalized):**
"You're sitting in the PT office, trying to do that leg lift exercise. Your back is screaming. The therapist is telling you to push through the pain. But you know deep down that this is making things worse, not better."

#### Pain Block Structure

For major pain points, create a "pain block":

**Structure:**
1. **Overarching Statement:** "You're stuck in a cycle of pain and frustration"
2. **3x Vivid Descriptions:**
   - "Every morning you wake up and the pain is still there"
   - "You're spending $200 a month on PT sessions that aren't working"
   - "You're missing out on activities you used to love"
3. **Concrete Experience:**
   - "You had to cancel plans with friends again because you're in too much pain. They're starting to think you're making excuses."
4. **Emotional Recap:**
   - "You feel trapped. Like you'll never get your life back."

---

### Section 3: Benefit Dimensionalization

#### Current Benefits Review

**Find all benefit claims and transform them:**

**Before (Generic):**
"Experience cellular-level healing"

**After (Dimensionalized):**
"You're lying in a zero-gravity chair, completely relaxed. No one is asking you to do painful exercises. No one is pushing on your sore spots. You're just... resting. And while you rest, your body is healing itself at the deepest level."

**Before (Generic):**
"Pain relief without exercises"

**After (Dimensionalized):**
"Imagine waking up tomorrow morning and rolling out of bed without that sharp pain in your lower back. You walk to the kitchen to make coffee, and you realize... you're not limping. You're not holding your breath waiting for the pain to hit. You're just... moving. Like you used to."

#### Benefit Block Structure

For major benefits, create a "benefit block":

**Structure:**
1. **Overarching Statement:** "You'll experience deep, lasting pain relief"
2. **3x Vivid Descriptions:**
   - "The pain that's been plaguing you for months starts fading"
   - "You're sleeping through the night for the first time in years"
   - "You're moving easier, feeling lighter, more energetic"
3. **Concrete Experience:**
   - "You're at a family gathering, and your sister says, 'You look so much better! What changed?' You smile and realize... you actually feel better. Not just 'managing' your pain, but actually healing."
4. **Emotional Recap:**
   - "You feel like yourself again. Like the person you were before the pain took over your life."

### Section 4: Social Impact Integration

#### Review All Benefits for Social Impact

**For each benefit, ask: "How does this affect how others perceive the reader?"**

**Example Transformations:**

**Before:**
"Improved mobility"

**After (with social impact):**
"Your family notices you're moving easier. Your grandkids can't believe how much more active you are. Your friends are asking what changed - you look years younger."

**Before:**
"Better sleep"

**After (with social impact):**
"Your spouse notices you're not tossing and turning all night. You're waking up refreshed, ready to tackle the day. People at work comment on how much more energy you have."

**Before:**
"Pain relief"

**After (with social impact):**
"You're not canceling plans anymore. You're showing up to family events. People are saying, 'You look so much better!' and you realize... you feel better too."

---

### Section 5: Present Progressive Tense Review

#### Verb Tense Check

**Find all past tense verbs and convert to present progressive where appropriate:**

**Before (Past Tense):**
"EES has helped hundreds of clients"

**After (Present Progressive):**
"EES is helping hundreds of clients right now"

**Before (Past Tense):**
"Many people found relief"

**After (Present Progressive):**
"People are finding relief every day"

#### When to Use Present Progressive

✅ **Use for:**
- Ongoing benefits
- Current results
- Active processes
- Things happening now

❌ **Don't use for:**
- Past stories/testimonials
- Historical facts
- Completed actions

---

### Section 6: Qualifier & Adverb Removal

#### Qualifier Hunt

**Find and remove these words:**

**Qualifiers to Remove:**
- may, might, could, possibly, probably, maybe
- some, mostly, partially, kind of, almost
- wondering if, considering, thinking about

**Before:**
"EES may be a better choice if you have difficulty performing exercises"

**After:**
"EES is the better choice when exercises cause more pain than relief"

**Before:**
"Many people are discovering that EES offers..."

**After:**
"Hundreds of people in Perrysburg are discovering that EES offers..."

#### Adverb Hunt

**Find and evaluate adverbs ending in -ly:**

**Common Adverbs:**
- extremely, very, really, quite, fairly
- probably, maybe, possibly, clearly
- easily, quickly, slowly, carefully

**Before:**
"The steps are extremely effective"

**After:**
"The steps are powerful" or "The steps work"

**Before:**
"You'll easily see results"

**After:**
"You'll see results" or "Results come quickly"

**Rule:** If the adverb doesn't add essential meaning, remove it. If it does, consider a stronger base word instead.

### Section 7: Conversational Language Review

#### Reading Level Check

- [ ] Shorter words preferred (Anglo-Saxon over Latin)
- [ ] Fewer consonants in words
- [ ] Short, rhythmic sentences
- [ ] Friend-to-friend tone

**Word Replacements:**

**Latin-based → Anglo-Saxon:**
- "utilize" → "use"
- "facilitate" → "help"
- "demonstrate" → "show"
- "implement" → "do"
- "approximately" → "about"

**Complex → Simple:**
- "revolutionary" → "new" or "powerful"
- "cutting-edge" → "advanced" or remove
- "comprehensive" → "complete" or remove
- "sophisticated" → "smart" or remove

#### Sentence Rhythm Check

- [ ] Mix of short and medium sentences
- [ ] No run-on sentences
- [ ] Natural pauses (commas, periods)
- [ ] Reads aloud smoothly

**Before:**
"Energy Enhancement System is revolutionary scalar wave technology developed by Dr. Sandra Rose Michael after decades of research in integrated biophysics."

**After:**
"Energy Enhancement System uses advanced energy technology. Dr. Sandra Rose Michael spent decades researching this. Now it's helping people heal at the deepest level."

### Section 8: Pain/Benefit Block Creation

#### For Major Pain Points

Create structured "pain blocks" using this format:

```
[Overarching Statement]

[3x Vivid Descriptions]

[1-2x Concrete "Lived-In" Experience]

[Emotional Recap]
```

**Example Pain Block:**

"You're stuck in a cycle of pain and frustration.

Every morning you wake up and the pain is still there. You're spending $200 a month on PT sessions that aren't working. You're missing out on activities you used to love.

You had to cancel plans with friends again because you're in too much pain. They're starting to think you're making excuses. Your family is worried about you, but you don't know what else to try.

You feel trapped. Like you'll never get your life back."

#### For Major Benefits

Create structured "benefit blocks" using this format:

```
[Overarching Statement]

[3x Vivid Descriptions]

[1-2x Concrete "Lived-In" Experience]

[Emotional Recap]
```

**Example Benefit Block:**

"You'll experience deep, lasting pain relief.

The pain that's been plaguing you for months starts fading. You're sleeping through the night for the first time in years. You're moving easier, feeling lighter, more energetic.

You're at a family gathering, and your sister says, 'You look so much better! What changed?' You smile and realize... you actually feel better. Not just 'managing' your pain, but actually healing.

You feel like yourself again. Like the person you were before the pain took over your life."
