			<h2>What is Float Tank Therapy?</h2>
			<div class="two-column-grid">
				<div>
					<img src="/images/placeholder.svg" alt="Float tank sensory deprivation chamber with Epsom salt water" class="section-image" loading="lazy" />
					<p>Float tank therapy, also called sensory deprivation therapy or flotation therapy, involves floating in a dark, soundproof tank filled with saltwater heated to skin temperature. The high concentration of Epsom salt allows you to float effortlessly while experiencing minimal sensory input.</p>

					<h3>How Float Tank Therapy Works</h3>
					<p>You enter a lightproof, soundproof tank filled with 10-12 inches of water saturated with 800-1,000 pounds of Epsom salt. The solution is heated to skin temperature, creating a sensation of weightlessness and reduced sensory input designed to promote deep relaxation and meditation.</p>

					<h3>Common Uses</h3>
					<ul class="checkmark-list">
						<li>Deep relaxation and stress relief</li>
						<li>Meditation enhancement</li>
						<li>Mental clarity and focus</li>
						<li>Anxiety reduction</li>
						<li>Creative thinking and problem-solving</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>Typical Costs in Perrysburg Area</h3>
					<div class="cost-box">
						<p><strong>Single float session:</strong> $50-80</p>
						<p><strong>First-time discount:</strong> $40-60</p>
						<p><strong>Monthly memberships:</strong> $120-200/month</p>
						<p><strong>Session duration:</strong> 60-90 minutes</p>
					</div>

					<h3 style="margin-top: 3rem;">Limitations</h3>
					<ul class="warning-list">
						<li>Claustrophobia in enclosed tank</li>
						<li>Isolation can feel uncomfortable for some</li>
						<li>Passive experience (no active healing)</li>

		<div class="container">
			<h2>When to Choose Energy Enhancement System Over Float Tank Therapy</h2>
			<p class="section-intro">EES may be a better choice if you:</p>

			<div class="scenarios-grid">
				<div class="scenario-card">
					<div class="scenario-icon">😰</div>
					<h3>1. You Feel Claustrophobic or Anxious in Enclosed Spaces</h3>
					<p>Many people love the idea of float therapy but feel anxious about being enclosed in a dark tank. EES provides the same deep relaxation and mental clarity without any isolation or confinement. You're in an open, peaceful room with comfortable zero-gravity chairs - no claustrophobia, no anxiety.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="scenario-card">
					<div class="scenario-icon">🎯</div>
					<h3>2. You Want Active Healing, Not Just Passive Relaxation</h3>
					<p>Float tanks offer passive relaxation through sensory deprivation. EES provides that same profound relaxation PLUS active cellular healing. While you're relaxing, the scalar wave technology is repairing DNA, regenerating cells, boosting immunity, and promoting whole-body healing. You get relaxation AND regeneration.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="scenario-card">
					<div class="scenario-icon">💧</div>
					<h3>3. You Don't Want to Get Wet or Deal with Saltwater</h3>
					<p>Float tanks mean wet hair, salt residue, and showering before and after. Some people find this inconvenient or uncomfortable. With EES, you stay completely dry - just recline in a comfortable chair. No wet hair, no salt, no cleanup. Come in your regular clothes and leave refreshed and dry.</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<h3>Conditions That Respond Well to EES</h3>
			<div class="conditions-list">
				<div class="condition-item">
					<h4>Chronic Stress and Anxiety</h4>
					<p>Both float tanks and EES provide stress relief, but EES works at the cellular level to regulate your nervous system long-term. While float tank relaxation is temporary, EES promotes lasting stress resilience through cellular regeneration and energy field coherence. Many clients report reduced anxiety for weeks after sessions.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="condition-item">
					<h4>Mental Clarity and Focus</h4>
					<p>Float tanks can provide mental clarity during and shortly after your session. EES enhances cognitive function at the cellular level, providing longer-lasting improvements in focus, mental clarity, and creative thinking. The scalar waves optimize brain cell function for sustained mental performance.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="condition-item">
					<h4>Sleep Issues and Insomnia</h4>
					<p>While float therapy can help you relax before bed, EES actually improves your sleep at the cellular level. The technology promotes deeper, more restorative sleep by enhancing your body's natural circadian rhythms and cellular repair processes that occur during sleep.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="condition-item">
					<h4>Multiple Health Concerns Beyond Relaxation</h4>
					<p>Float tanks focus solely on relaxation and meditation. EES provides deep relaxation PLUS cellular healing, immune support, pain relief, energy restoration, and whole-body regeneration. If you're seeking more than just a relaxation experience, EES offers comprehensive wellness benefits.</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="testimonial-highlight">
				<blockquote>
					<p>"I tried float tanks but felt too claustrophobic and anxious in the enclosed space. EES gives me all the deep relaxation and mental clarity I was seeking, but I'm comfortable in an open room. Plus, my sleep has improved dramatically and I have way more energy now!"</p>

	<!-- When Float Tank Might Be Better Section -->
	<section class="section when-pt-better">
		<div class="container">
			<h2>When Float Tank Therapy Might Be a Better Choice</h2>
			<p class="intro-text">We believe in honest, transparent information. Float tank therapy may be more appropriate if:</p>

			<ul class="honest-list">
				<li><strong>You specifically seek sensory deprivation meditation:</strong> If you're drawn to the unique experience of complete sensory isolation and water immersion.</li>
				<li><strong>You have no claustrophobia concerns:</strong> Some people find the enclosed tank environment deeply meditative rather than anxiety-inducing.</li>
				<li><strong>You prefer shorter sessions:</strong> If 60-90 minutes is your ideal session length (EES sessions are 2+ hours).</li>
			</ul>

			<div class="complementary-box">
				<h3>Can You Use Both?</h3>
				<p><strong>Absolutely!</strong> Many clients find that EES complements float tank therapy beautifully. EES can:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Provide the relaxation benefits of floating without the isolation or water</li>
					<li>Add cellular healing and regeneration that float tanks don't offer</li>
					<li>Extend the mental clarity and stress relief from floating through cellular support</li>
					<li>Offer an alternative when you want deep relaxation without getting wet</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="cta-text">Consider alternating between both, or transitioning primarily to EES for more comprehensive wellness benefits.</p>

			<h2>Frequently Asked Questions: EES vs Float Tank Therapy</h2>

			<div class="faq-list">
				<div class="faq-item">
					<button class="faq-question">
						<span>Can EES provide the same deep relaxation as a float tank?</span>
						<span class="faq-icon">+</span>
					</button>
					<div class="faq-answer">
						<p>Yes, and often more profound! Many clients who've tried both report that EES provides equal or deeper relaxation than float tanks, but without the isolation, claustrophobia, or discomfort some people experience in tanks. The scalar wave technology promotes deep relaxation at the cellular level, affecting your entire nervous system. Plus, you get active healing benefits that float tanks simply can't provide.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="faq-item">
					<button class="faq-question">
						<span>I get claustrophobic - is EES really different from a float tank?</span>
						<span class="faq-icon">+</span>
					</button>
					<div class="faq-answer">
						<p>Completely different! Float tanks are enclosed, isolated spaces that can trigger claustrophobia. EES sessions take place in an open, spacious room with comfortable zero-gravity chairs. There's no confinement, no darkness, no isolation. Many people who felt anxious or panicked in float tanks find EES to be completely comfortable and relaxing.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="faq-item">
					<button class="faq-question">
						<span>Do I stay dry with EES or do I get wet like in a float tank?</span>
						<span class="faq-icon">+</span>
					</button>
					<div class="faq-answer">
						<p>You stay completely dry! Unlike float tanks where you're submerged in saltwater, EES requires no water at all. Simply recline in a comfortable zero-gravity chair in your regular clothes. No wet hair, no salt residue, no need to shower afterwards. Come in, relax, and leave dry and refreshed.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="faq-item">
					<button class="faq-question">
						<span>How does EES compare to float tanks for mental clarity and meditation?</span>
						<span class="faq-icon">+</span>
					</button>
					<div class="faq-answer">
						<p>Both can enhance mental clarity, but EES works at a deeper level. Float tanks provide mental clarity through sensory deprivation, which is temporary. EES enhances cognitive function at the cellular level by optimizing brain cell health and energy field coherence. Many clients report sustained improvements in focus, creativity, and mental clarity that last far beyond their session.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="faq-item">
					<button class="faq-question">
						<span>Can I do both float therapy and EES?</span>
						<span class="faq-icon">+</span>
					</button>
					<div class="faq-answer">
						<p>Absolutely! Some clients enjoy both modalities. EES provides cellular healing and long-term benefits, while float tanks offer a unique sensory deprivation experience. Many people use EES as their primary wellness therapy and occasionally enjoy float tanks as well. There's no conflict between the two approaches.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="faq-item">
					<button class="faq-question">
						<span>Which is better for stress relief - float tank or EES?</span>
						<span class="faq-icon">+</span>
					</button>
					<div class="faq-answer">
						<p>Both provide stress relief, but through different mechanisms. Float tanks offer temporary stress relief through sensory deprivation. EES provides stress relief at the cellular level by regulating your nervous system and promoting coherence in your body's energy field. The benefits are cumulative and longer-lasting. Plus, there's no anxiety from being in an enclosed tank, which can actually increase stress for some people.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="faq-item">
					<button class="faq-question">
						<span>How long do the relaxation benefits last compared to float therapy?</span>
						<span class="faq-icon">+</span>
					</button>
					<div class="faq-answer">
						<p>Float tank relaxation is typically temporary - lasting hours to a couple days. EES provides cumulative benefits that build over time. Many clients report feeling relaxed and balanced for weeks after sessions, with benefits that deepen with regular use. This is because EES works at the cellular level to improve your body's fundamental health and resilience, not just providing temporary sensory relaxation.</p>
